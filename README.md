🌾 FasalRakshak AI

AI-Powered Crop Disease Detection & Evidence-Weighted Outbreak Intelligence

FasalRakshak AI is an AI-powered agricultural web application that helps identify crop diseases from plant/leaf images and provides disease information, crop-health scoring, reliability analysis, monitoring history, and geographically organized outbreak intelligence.

Core idea: An increase in reports does not always mean an increase in independent evidence.

The platform combines AI-based disease detection with confidence analysis, crop-health assessment, monitoring history, and evidence-weighted geographic outbreak intelligence.

🌱 Project Overview

FasalRakshak AI follows this workflow:

Farmer uploads crop/leaf image
          ↓
Image preprocessing
          ↓
AI disease detection
          ↓
Confidence & reliability analysis
          ↓
Crop Health Score
          ↓
Symptoms / Fertilizer / Prevention guidance
          ↓
Monitoring history
          ↓
Evidence-weighted outbreak intelligence
          ↓
Interactive geographic map

🎯 Problem Statement

Crop diseases can spread before farmers are able to recognize a wider pattern.

A single disease report may indicate an isolated case, while many reports from the same area may be caused by repeated reporting of the same local observation. Therefore, simply counting reports may not provide enough evidence of a developing outbreak.

FasalRakshak AI explores an evidence-weighted approach that considers:

Disease prediction confidence

Geographic distribution

Independent evidence

Time trends

Image/reliability signals

💡 Solution

FasalRakshak AI combines crop disease detection with monitoring and outbreak intelligence.

Instead of treating:

More Reports → Outbreak

as sufficient evidence, the project uses the concept:

Evidence
+ Geographic Diversity
+ Disease Confidence
+ Time Trend
        ↓
Outbreak Signal

The outbreak functionality is designed as a demonstration of this concept rather than a real epidemiological diagnosis system.

🚀 Key Features

1. AI Crop Disease Detection

Upload a crop or leaf image and the trained AI model predicts the most likely disease/class.

2. Prediction Confidence

The result page displays the model's prediction confidence.

Example:

Tomato Late Blight
Confidence: 91%

3. AI Reliability Analysis

The application can consider multiple signals instead of relying only on the top prediction probability:

Prediction confidence

Prediction margin

Image quality

Feature similarity

Reference examples

Alternative predictions

Image/view consistency where available

When a result is considered unreliable, the system can warn the user instead of presenting it as a definitive diagnosis.

4. Uncertainty Warning

Uncertain predictions can trigger a warning recommending a clearer image.

5. Top Predictions

The application can display alternative candidate predictions rather than hiding them.

6. Crop Health Score

A simplified 0–100 Crop Health Score helps make the AI output easier to understand.

Example:

Crop Health: 78 / 100

7. Disease Symptoms

Disease-specific symptoms are displayed on the result page.

8. Fertilizer Guidance

The application provides general fertilizer/nutritional guidance associated with the detected condition.

9. Prevention Guidance

The result page provides practical prevention recommendations.

10. Multilingual Interface

Supported languages:

English

Hindi

Marathi

Translation logic is maintained in translations.py.

11. Image Upload

Supported image formats:

JPG
JPEG
PNG
WEBP

Maximum upload size:

5 MB

12. Interactive Outbreak Map

The outbreak intelligence page provides an interactive geographic map showing organized outbreak information and demonstration scenarios.

13. Geographic Clustering

Disease reports can be organized into geographic clusters to explore areas where multiple reports may represent a localized outbreak.

14. Monitoring History

Previous crop scans can be stored locally using SQLite.

History can include:

Date/time

Crop

Disease

Confidence

Crop Health Score

15. History Statistics

The history page can show:

Total scans

Average confidence

Healthy scans

Disease scans

Historical crop-health information

⚠️ Disclaimer

FasalRakshak AI is a project prototype for crop disease detection, monitoring, and evidence-weighted outbreak intelligence.

AI predictions and outbreak demonstrations should not be treated as a substitute for professional agricultural or plant-disease diagnosis.

Real-world model performance may differ from validation performance depending on image quality, environment, crop variety, disease appearance, and other field conditions.
